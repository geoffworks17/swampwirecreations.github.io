			<p>After a two week hiatus from the MPCNC, I got the itch to get back to making things. I wanted to salvage the spoilboard as much as I could, level it out, and create a few clamps to making workpiece holding a little easier.</p>
<h2 id="spoilboard-recovery">Spoilboard Recovery</h2>
<p>Last time I worked on the CNC, I ended up with a two part spoilboard where the second part did not match the alignment of holes in the first part. This essentially rendered the two-part assembly useless.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb01.jpg" alt="Surfacing Bit"></p>
<p>I decided to make the lower part of the board the only part, which meant using a surfacing bit to make the entire work area level and perpendicular to the router.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb02.jpg" alt="Countersunk Inserts"></p>
<p>I planned a 1mm clearing operation over the entire work are of the board (776x511 mm, or a little over 30x20 inches). To keep from hitting any of the threaded inserts, I drilled them further into the board, leaving a few millimeters of of space between the top of the insert and the spoilboard surface.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb03.jpg" alt="A few passes"></p>
<p>After a few passes, I could tell this was the right choice. The cut took about 10 minutes to clear the board.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb04.jpg" alt="Dusty"></p>
<p>I was surprised at how much of the generated dust was not collected by the vacuum. I am using an inexpensive wet/dry vac designed for cleaning cars, which pulls less current than my main shop-vac.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb05.jpg" alt="Don&rsquo;t forget to wear your dust mask"></p>
<p>To make sure nothing goes wrong during cuts, I have been staying in the garage with the machine during the entire cutting operation. Don&rsquo;t forget to wear your dust mask!</p>
<p>The spoilboard came out nice and flat, and I was ready to move on to the other part of the project.</p>
<h2 id="workholding-clamps">Workholding Clamps</h2>
<p>A key part of any CNC router is a workholding system. This can be a simple as double-sided tape, to as complex as hinged clamps that slide on a t-slot system. For my MPCNC, I wanted a set of slotted bars could be bolted into the threaded inserts, resulting in a low profile and easy-to-use clamping system.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb08.jpg" alt="First Try"></p>
<p>My first try was with 3/4&quot; plywood. If I had put a little more thought into this, I would have realized this was going to be way too tall. It did give me a chance to test out my feeds and speeds on this type of material. A few false starts later, and I had my first clamp.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb06.jpg" alt="Stock"></p>
<p>I realized I wanted something a little smaller than the plywood. Looking around the shop, I found a few 8x8 inch pieces of 2 mm sheeting I had originally used for laser cutting. This was a little too thin for clamps, so I sandwiched three of them together with some wood glue to make a sturdy 6 mm piece of stock for my clamps. This was left under some cement blocks overnight for the glue to dry.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb09.jpg" alt="Making do"></p>
<p>The next morning, I planned out a cut of 6 clamps, which should give me enough to work with for the time being. Using a few washers and my thick plywood clamp, I tightened the stock down and set up the operation.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb10.jpg" alt="Making more"></p>
<p>The clamps were designed to be 4 inches long, which stretched beyond the end of my material. Since the inner slot is still intact, I don&rsquo;t think this will cause and problems or clamping failures.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb11.jpg" alt="Front Side"></p>
<p>15 minutes of machining later, and I had my clamps cut out.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb12.jpg" alt="Back Side"></p>
<p>Since the stock was 6 mm thick, and I set my cut for 6 mm, I ended up with a few spots where it didn&rsquo;t quite cut through. If i had set the cutting depth just another millimeter thicker, it would have cut clear thought everywhere. All I had to do was bend the board a bit, and the pieces snapped right out.</p>
<p><img src="/img/20/11-MPCNC-getting-better/11mgb13.jpg" alt="After some Dremel work"></p>
<p>After a few passes with a sanding drum on a rotary tool, the clamps were ready for use. This will make it much easier to set up future cuts without scrambling and scrounging around for washers and makeshift clamps.</p>
